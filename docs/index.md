## Why DevTrail?

As AI coding assistants become integral to development, critical questions emerge:

- **Who made this change?** Human or AI?
- **Why was this decision made?** What alternatives were considered?
- **Should this be reviewed?** Is human oversight needed?
- **What's the impact?** How risky is this change?

DevTrail answers all of these with structured, traceable documentation.
