## Welcome

DevTrail ensures that every significant change in your codebase—whether made by a human or AI—is **documented, attributed, and reviewable**.

> **"No significant change without a documented trace."**

---

## Why DevTrail?

As AI coding assistants become integral to development, critical questions emerge:

- **Who made this change?** Human or AI?
- **Why was this decision made?** What alternatives were considered?
- **Should this be reviewed?** Is human oversight needed?
- **What's the impact?** How risky is this change?

DevTrail answers all of these with structured, traceable documentation.
